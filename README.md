### What is VLink?

VLink is a developer tool that allows for Unity games and applications to be linked to blockchain applications no matter the device. It’s mainly aimed towards alternative devices such as VR headsets which currently don’t have any simple methods of connecting to a web3 wallet.

### Why is VLink so important?

With how VR is constantly updating and improving every day, it’s already made a clear place in modern technology and will only continue to get larger. So with even the largest groups in VR such as Meta not natively supporting any web3 wallets and integration being so desirable it’s clear that something has to be done. Hence the importance of VLink which can help tie together these two rapidly improving technologies to create the future.

### How does VLink work?

VLink uses a secure connection to MQTT server to transmit encrypted data between a website supporting web3 technology and Unity on any device with an internet connection. To use it, users simply start their app in Unity and are provided with a unique 5-digit code which acts as the pairing link for the provided website. Next, the user can navigate to the provided website on a secondary device with a web3 wallet and sign in with their wallet of choice. Finally, they just copy across the unique 5-digit code they were given and they’re done. The system will automatically send the wallet address to the device running Unity for later use. In addition, provided the user leaves the website open and running, the Unity application can then run JavaScript functions from within the game allowing any smart contract to be triggered from in game events or any existing web3 tools to be easily integrated without any trouble.
